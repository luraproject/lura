An open framework to assemble ultra performance API Gateways with middlewares; formerly known as _KrakenD framework_, and core service of the [KrakenD API Gateway](http://www.krakend.io).

## Motivation

Consumers of REST API content (specially in microservices) often query backend services that weren't coded for the UI implementation. This is of course a good practice, but the UI consumers need to do implementations that suffer a lot of complexity and burden with the sizes of their microservices responses.

Lura is an **API Gateway** builder and proxy generator that sits between the client and all the source servers, adding a new layer that removes all the complexity to the clients, providing them only the information that the UI needs. Lura acts as an **aggregator** of many sources into single endpoints and allows you to group, wrap, transform and shrink responses. Additionally it supports a myriad of middlewares and plugins that allow you to extend the functionality, such as adding Oauth authorization or security layers.

Lura not only supports HTTP(S), but because it is a set of generic libraries you can build all type of API Gateways and proxies, including for instance, an RPC gateway.

### Practical Example

A mobile developer needs to construct a single front page that requires data from 4 different calls to their backend services, e.g:

    1) api.store.server/products
    2) api.store.server/marketing-promos
    3) api.users.server/users/{id_user}
    4) api.users.server/shopping-cart/{id_user}

The screen is very simple, and the mobile client _only_ needs to retrieve data from 4 different sources, wait for the round trip and then hand pick only a few fields from the response.

What if the mobile could call a single endpoint?

    1) lura.server/frontpage/{id_user}

That's something Lura can do for you. And this is how it would look like:

Lura would merge all the data and return only the fields you need (the difference in size in the graph).

## What's in this repository?

The source code for the [Lura project](https://luraproject.org) framework. It is designed to work with your own middleware and extend the functionality by using small, independent, reusable components following the Unix philosophy.

Use this repository if you want to **build from source your API Gateway** or if you want to **reuse the components in another application**.

If you need a fully functional API Gateway you can [download the KrakenD binary for your architecture](http://www.krakend.io/download) or [build it yourself](https://github.com/krakend/krakend-ce).


## Library Usage
The Lura project is presented as a **Go library** that you can include in your own Go application to build a powerful proxy or API gateway. For a complete example, check the [KrakenD CE repository](https://github.com/krakend/krakend-ce).

Of course, you will need [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system to compile the code.

A ready to use example:

```go
    package main

    import (
        "flag"
        "log"
        "os"

        "github.com/luraproject/lura/config"
        "github.com/luraproject/lura/logging"
        "github.com/luraproject/lura/proxy"
        "github.com/luraproject/lura/router/gin"
    )

    func main() {
        port := flag.Int("p", 0, "Port of the service")
        logLevel := flag.String("l", "ERROR", "Logging level")
        debug := flag.Bool("d", false, "Enable the debug")
        configFile := flag.String("c", "/etc/lura/configuration.json", "Path to the configuration filename")
        flag.Parse()

        parser := config.NewParser()
        serviceConfig, err := parser.Parse(*configFile)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal("ERROR:", err.Error())
        }
        serviceConfig.Debug = serviceConfig.Debug || *debug
        if *port != 0 {
            serviceConfig.Port = *port
        }

        logger, _ := logging.NewLogger(*logLevel, os.Stdout, "[LURA]")

        routerFactory := gin.DefaultFactory(proxy.DefaultFactory(logger), logger)

        routerFactory.New().Run(serviceConfig)
    }
```
